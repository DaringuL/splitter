## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
It was a great opportunity to better understand React hooks, such as useState() and useEffect(). Also I once again trained mobile-first development of CSS layout.

### Continued development
I still want to figure out how to make warning span for zero persons input, which however wouldn't be shown at default state as long as according to design screenshots default state should be 0.
